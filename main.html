<center><h1>wxZoom: a screen magnification utility</h1></center>

<h2>What it is?</h2>

<p>I have decided to make publicly available a small program which I have
written because I needed it myself and found the standard <tt>xmag</tt>
utility to be thoroughly insufficient for my needs.

<p>The extra features compared to <tt>xmag</tt> include more convenient choice
of the screen part to show, possibility to resize the window (and the part
being magnified), increase and decrease zoom factor in one key press and the
possibility to view the grid (for easier pixel counting) and the colour of the
pixel under mouse in RGB and, most importantly for me, autorefresh of the view
which allows to observe changing objects on screen.

<p>If I can find some time I will try to also add the following in the next
version:
<ul>
	<li>saving of the magnified image in standard formats (PNG/JPEG/GIF)
	<li>make it much more efficient: currently it's awfully dumb and so
	    there is a lot of unnecessary flicker
	<li>UI improvements (too many to list here).
</ul>

<p>If you have anything else in mind don't hesitate to contact me.

<h2>Where to get it?</h2>

<p>Download the sources or binaries (Win32 or Linux RPM only for the latter)
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15266&release_id=17344">
here</a>.

<p>If you download the Windows binary, you will need precompiled
<a href="www.wxwindows.org">wxWindows</a> DLL for Win32 which can be found in
the same location. Just unzip both files into any directory and run the
executable.

<p>For Linux, you may get the RPM containing wxWindows from
<a href="http://www-fs.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~wxxt/download.html">wxGTK</a>
home site (you only need runtime RPM for wxZoom.rpm but development package if
you want to compile it yourself).

<p>For other systems you don't have any choice but to compile wxZoom yourself.
Luckily, this is very simple: it just requires wxWindows development package to
be installed, but after this building it is a matter of typing
<pre>
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
</pre>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>

<p>After launching the program you can press the left mouse button in the window
and drag it to select the screen area to view. You can increase/decrease the
zoom level with Ctrl-I/Ctrl-O (also from the menu) and you can also refresh
the window either manually (F5) or automatically (Ctrl-A) using a configurable
interval.

<p>Miscellaneous other features:

<ul>
   <li>you can toggle the grid lines display with Ctrl-G.
   <li>when the mouse is inside the window, the second pane of the status bar
       displays the colour of the pixel under the pointer in hex RGB format.
   <li>you can open new program windows with Ctrl-N
</ul>
